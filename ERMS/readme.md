#  Engineering Resource Management System

##  Overview

A full-stack application to manage engineering team assignments across projects. Track whoâ€™s working on what, how much capacity is used, and plan future allocations with ease.

> **Duration:** 2 Days (16 hours)  
> **Stack:** React + TypeScript (frontend), Node.js + Express (backend), MongoDB (database), pnpm (package manager)

##  Sample JSON Data

### ðŸ”¹ User (Engineer)

```json
{
  "name": "John Doe",
  "email": "john@company.com",
  "role": "engineer",
  "skills": ["React", "Node.js"],
  "seniority": "mid",
  "maxCapacity": 100,
  "department": "Frontend"
}
```

### ðŸ”¹ Project

```json
{
  "name": "Website Redesign",
  "description": "Modernize the UI/UX",
  "startDate": "2024-06-01",
  "endDate": "2024-08-01",
  "requiredSkills": ["React", "Tailwind"],
  "teamSize": 3,
  "status": "active",
  "managerId": "663fa9..."
}
```

### ðŸ”¹ Assignment

```json
{
  "engineerId": "663fa0...",
  "projectId": "663fa1...",

##  AI-Powered Development

### Tools Used

- **ChatGPT**: API design, validation functions, error handling

### Examples

- Generated 70% of the initial form validation logic in React Hook Form
- Refactored MongoDB aggregation queries using AI code review
- Prompted ChatGPT for Express API best practices

### Challenges

- AI suggested verbose logic for capacity calc â€“ rewrote it for clarity
- Occasional misuse of Mongoose schema types, which we caught in testing



##  Sample Seed Data

Includes:

-  4 Engineers (mix of seniority, skills, capacities)
-  3 Projects (planning, active, completed)
-  6 Assignments (varying percentages and durations)

---

##  Success Criteria

- Engineers show correct available capacity
- Assignments update in real-time UI
- Managers can filter by skill/project/status
- Clean UI usable by non-tech managers
